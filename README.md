## Overview

In this lesson, we'll go in depth with handling and creating events in Vue. We saw a little bit of this in a previous lesson, but we'll go deeper into what events are and how they communicate within our application.

## What Are Events

Events are actions that are triggered during a certain behaviour being performed such as a `click` or `input`. Typically we can define these as user events. For example, when a user types into a form, this would trigger an `input` event. Or when a button is clicked, this would trigger a `click` event.

Events allow our application to be interactve which leads to a better user experience.
